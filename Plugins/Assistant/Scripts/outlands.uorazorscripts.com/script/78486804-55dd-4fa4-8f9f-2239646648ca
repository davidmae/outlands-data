#Have DECODED Skinning map and Skinning knife in backpack
#This script does not check for capita, I do one manually to do capita then run the script 
#Thank you to JaseOwns for some tweaking to allow us to recall home after map is complete
#You will need a recall script I use this one https://outlands.uorazorscripts.com/script/5b3fde97-fa90-4707-9f8e-7f56dca6792b  and have it named __RECALL__
