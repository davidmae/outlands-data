## Script: Loot Dump and Resupply by Goapirat
## Created by: Goapirat#3352
#############################################

// Script by Goapirat 09/22 v4.1
// This is loot dump restock script that uses ideal following items when they are 2 tiles near you:
// bank deposit safe, recource stockpile, recycler, repair bench, storage shelf
//
//   >> Set your organizer 1 to your Bank Safe and add Gold and Doubs to it <<
//
// The script asks for your TomeChest. 
// If You have your Tomes in a chest => Target TomeChest
// If you have your Tomes locked 2 Tiles near you in your house => Target yourself
// Then the Script runs automatically.
//
// It dumps your gold into your bank deposit safe. 
// Restocks your recource container. 
// Moves unidetified items to your recycler.
// It repairs your inventory and warn equippment.
// Uses Shelf to clear your inventory and takes your current loadout.
//
// V4.1 Added Doubloons
