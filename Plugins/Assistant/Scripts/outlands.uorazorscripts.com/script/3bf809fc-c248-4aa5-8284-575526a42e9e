## Script: Simple Smelt From Backpack And Pack Animal
## Created by: Nalco#9505
#############################################

# Simple script to smelt ore inside your pack. Also opens your pack animal and smelts the ore inside of your animals pack. 
# After smelting is complete, will run an organizer to put your ingots into a container.
# Llama ID needs to be set in script options
# I use organizer 3 for ingots. Change to the organizer you want to use.
