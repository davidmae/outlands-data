## AFK Bard Chivalry Maid by Spiraal
## Requires AFK character with Chivalry, Provocation, Peacemaking, Discordance.

## Bard Chivalry Maid will cast Provocation, Peacemaking and Discordance every 11 seconds.

## If dagger is dropped near Bard Chivalry Maid, they will attempt every 11 seconds to cast Sacred Journey to dungeons (about 30 second cooldown per gate).
## If scissors is dropped near Bard Chivalry Maid, they will attempt every 11 seconds to cast Sacred Journey to towns (about 30 second cooldown per gate).


## Bard Chivalry Maid will invite nearby players every 11 seconds, comment line with ## or delete lines with "menu 0 7" if this is not preferred.

## March 10th, 2023 update: Added self heal equal to or under 40 HP back to 100 HP. Bard Chivalry Maid can now be used as a weapon skill training dummy (must be flagged green)
