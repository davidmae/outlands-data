# eat magery mushroom with cd display by Isc4riot
# eat a mushroom when it is off cd and you have less than 75 mana to not waste it
# can spam the button while meditating to show the cooldown without it breaking
# using other scripts doesnt mess with the timer
# if someone feels like fancying it up further go ahead
