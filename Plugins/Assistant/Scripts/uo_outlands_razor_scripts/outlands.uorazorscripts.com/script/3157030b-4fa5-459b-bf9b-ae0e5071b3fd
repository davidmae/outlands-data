#Yottawatts's ULTIMATE 2Hander Healing Script 8/10/22
#NOTE: Create a Dress List for your weapon!
#Note 2!: Set your undress container as a trapped pouch or boom chest!!
#You will undress to a trapped pouch and dress from it, no more stolen weapons!
#Note: You cannot set dress container yet or set item hue, use serial
#Remove Notes as needed!
#Remember to reset Dress Serial and Undress bag if you die!(also exit inn for bag)
#NOTE 3: Change dress ID as needed and findtype at line 46
#Hotkeys for potions seem faster!
#Change Notes: Added Cast Function and Reequip to each potion.
#Casting a spell unequips a weapon and bypasses weight limits if overweight
#(no need for 1 hander) (need a spellbook with the spell for this to work)
#Spell Note: Use create food spell in overworld wilderness, recall locks you.
