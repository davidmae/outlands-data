# Description:
#  Run this script on a hotkey (ALT-D)
#  It will bring up a cursor, select
#  a person you want to snoop.  This
#  will bring up their profile paperdoll and set
#  their backpack as mySnoopTargetBack
#  We'll use another hotkey to interact with mySnoopTargetBack
setvar mySnoopTarget
dclick mySnoopTarget
if findtype 3701 mySnoopTarget as tbag
    setvar mySnoopTargetBack tbag
    # if you don't want to use another macro, uncomment 
    # the line below to double click the backpack and set it as last object
    #dclick tbag
