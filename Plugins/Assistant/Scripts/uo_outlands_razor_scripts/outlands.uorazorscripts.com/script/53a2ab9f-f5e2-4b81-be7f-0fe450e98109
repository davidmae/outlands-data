# Test your gold drop off - Bank deposit  by Jaseowns

##  Some people report that my organizer script is eating their gold.  I didn't believe.
## Shampoo let me in his out to try it out and sure enough, it was eating the gold.
#  dropping off on a bank deposit should return a system message.. for some safes (i think it depends on the position) you don't get this message but your gold goes away
# I'll attach this script with a video example to file in bug report.

# -1 -1 -1 is the "fix" and it already in my other drop off script as of 2/21/2023 4:23 PM CST
