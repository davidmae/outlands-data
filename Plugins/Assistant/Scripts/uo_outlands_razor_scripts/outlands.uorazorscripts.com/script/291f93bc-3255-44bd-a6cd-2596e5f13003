# Set Trapped Loot Pouch and move weapon into pouch or take it out by Jaseowns
# UO Outlands
# Description:
#   This is a proof of concept for a question about moving
#   your weapon into a trapped pouch and then pulling it back out   
# Requirements:
#   This assumes you are using a right hand weapon (I tested with a cross bow)
