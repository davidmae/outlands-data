# Bandage Self Scripts for UO Outlands by Jaseowns
If you want to replace the default bandage self script, use Aids.razor.  If you want that button to cure, use the AidsCure.razor.  If you want that button to heal pot, cure and aid - use AidsCureHeal.razor.

If you want to try the loop script, remember any hotkeys that are run will stop the script. Also if you try and target something while the script is running, it has the possibility of flagging you grey.

Check out the video on how to use these scripts here:
